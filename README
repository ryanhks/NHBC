My name is Ryan Shontell. I am a Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Student at the University of Hawaii
currently working on a project with Dr. Lenora Loo at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center.
The project is to investigate the biological differences between clinically diagnosed ER+ breat cancers
between Native Hawaiians and Whites that lead to poor prognosis. 

I am currently using Python3.6. The scripts are written with several plugins that must be installed through Anaconda.

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda

The plug ins include
-pandas
-numpy
-openpyxl
-xlrd

I am learning as I work on this project, so the scripts are going to be rough and bulky, but they do their job. If you need
any help in running them, please feel free to email me: ryankhs@hawaii.edu
