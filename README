I am currently using Python3.6. The scripts are written with several plugins that must be installed through Anaconda.

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda

The plugins include
-pandas
-numpy
-openpyxl
-xlrd

I am learning as I work on this project, so the scripts are going to be rough and bulky, but they do their job. If you need
any help in running them, please feel free to email me: ryankhs@hawaii.edu
